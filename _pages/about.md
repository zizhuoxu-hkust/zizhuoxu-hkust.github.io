I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Data Science and Analytics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am jointly supervised by Prof. [Lei Li](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=104) and Prof. [Xiaofang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaofang-zhou/home?authuser=0). Prior to my time at HKUST, I earned the M.Sc. degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from the Cornell University, and my B.Eng. degree in Applied Economics and Statistics from University of Delaware.

My research interests lie at the spatio-temporal temporal data management. By construct index structure for the future route data, we can efficiently and accurately support further applications such as traffic prediction, route planning, traffic simulation, traffic signal control, .etc. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
